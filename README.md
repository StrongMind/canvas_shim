# CanvasShim
Canvas Shim is a rails engine that allows us to add functionality to Canvas LMS without changing the code base.  Additionally it provides services like Pipeline, see corresponding docs like PIPELINE_SERVICE_README.md to learn more about services.


## Usage
This Rails engine now allows decorating classes/modules/etc in Canvas LMS without altering Canvas's files

It can also be used as a standard Rails engine with it's own routes/controllers/views/etc

**To decorate controllers, helpers, models, lib stuff from CanvasLMS**

- Create an **_almost same named_** file using format "{filename}_decorator.rb" under Shim's /app/decorators following the same CanvasLMS path
- Then use .class_eval to override/extend the class being decorated or use Rails concerns

**To decorate a view from CanvasLMS**

- Create the **_same named_** file under /app/views following the same CanvasLMS path

    This file will get picked up in the engine first before it's found in CanvasLMS.  This overrides the
entire file giving you maximum flexibility to make edits, while keeping the original in CanvasLMS
for review or later upgrades

**To include assets JS/CSS into Canvas LMS**

If you're decorating a page in CanvasLMS and need assets

- In your overriding view wrap your js/css includes in a :strongming_assets block, this block is yielded at the bottom of Canvas's application layout

```html
<% content_for :strongmind_assets do %>
  <%= stylesheet_link_tag    "canvas_shim/application", media: "all" %>
  <%= javascript_include_tag 'canvas_shim/application' %>
<% end %>
```
- If you're working in views that are a part of the shim engine, and you want shim to have a unique layout, everything works at a typical Rails app where Shim has it's own layout(s) for it's internal controllers

- **Note** that jQuery's ready event doesn't seem to fire with Canvas, you should be able to use window.on 'load' instead

```javascript
$(window).on("load", function(event) {
  // Some awesome code here
})
```
